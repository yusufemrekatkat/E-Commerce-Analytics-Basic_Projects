### 1. 📉 Churn Prediction (Retention)
**Goal:** To protect profitability by proactively identifying and preventing customer churn.
* **Method:** Random Forest & Logistic Regression
* **Key Insight:** Demonstrated that the frequency of **customer support calls** is a significantly higher risk indicator than pricing sensitivity.

### 2. 💰 Pricing Optimization (Revenue)
**Goal:** To identify the "Optimal Price" point that maximizes total revenue.
* **Method:** Linear Regression & Calculus (Derivatives)
* **Key Insight:** Calculated **Price Elasticity**, identifying the equilibrium point that increases profit margins without sacrificing significant sales volume.

### 3. 🛡️ SENTINEL: Fraud Detection (Trust)
**Goal:** To detect financial anomalies in real-time without labeled historical data.
* **Method:** Isolation Forest (Unsupervised Learning)
* **Key Insight:** Successfully isolated "low-value but high-frequency" **bot attacks** that traditional rule-based systems often fail to detect.
